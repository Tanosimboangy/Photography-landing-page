#   **My experience:**

  -  Since this project is based upon HTML and CSS, displaying each item can be complicated.

  -  First of all, After having set all of the necessary files, such as index.html, index.scss, I installed sass and run it so that it compiles the scss styles into css and the browser won't have difficulty to render it. 

  - Secondly, I tried to style all of the elements and set up the javascript code for the slider images. I had a great deal of difficulty to tackle with this part.

#   **In a few sentences, explain the structure of my project:**

  - First and foremost, Inside of index.html I write the whole code with a small part of javascript.

  - Lately, I tried to use parcel to run the run this code to the browser.

#  **If I had more time, I would you improve:**
  - First, I would like to improve the way how I display all of the links icons like facebook and twitter by using another fill when it is hovered by the user.

  - Also, I would cleanse my code very well so that it's easy for others to understand it.

#   **New I learned while working on this project:**
  - I learned that we could use parcel instead of sass, and this make your life even easier to deal with everthing.
